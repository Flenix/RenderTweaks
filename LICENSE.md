REGARDING MODPACKS:
You may include my mod in a modpack, but must do all of the following BEFORE including it:
- 1. Send me a message, telling me you are doing so, and await my reply with my approval
- 2. Wherever your public mod credit list is, put my name, and a link to the mod

Note: I do not accept Technic packs and my mods are coded to block them. I'll only approve established and well-made packs, never private or badly made ones.

You must have FULL permission for all the mods in your modpack, especially if you're distributing publicly.

You may not make any money off my mod, unless you've discussed with me first. This includes things like adfly.
General server donations are acceptible so long as you're running multiple mods (not just mine).
